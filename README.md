# IRTify

IRTify is a powerful tool for analyzing test data, providing comprehensive insights into Item Response Theory (IRT) and Differential Item Functioning (DIF). Built using Streamlit in Python, this app leverages R for conducting detailed statistical analyses, allowing educators, researchers, and psychometricians to effortlessly explore and interpret test performance data, ensuring a deeper understanding of test reliability and validity.

## Features
- **Item Response Theory Analysis**: Gain detailed insights into item characteristics and examine test-taker abilities using various IRT models.
- **Differential Item Functioning**: Identify items that function differently across diverse groups of test-takers, ensuring fairness and equity in testing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and interactive Streamlit interface for easy navigation and analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Generate and export various plots to visualize IRT parameters and DIF results.
- **Data Import/Export**: Seamlessly import test data and export analysis results for further use.
- **R Integration**: Advanced statistical analyses are performed using R, ensuring robust and accurate results.
